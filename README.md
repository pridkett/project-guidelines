Project Guidelines
==================

Overview
--------

Whenever I start a new project I keep on finding myself looking for a template that I can use for things like `CONTRIBUTING.md`, team norms, and various GitHub templates. It's especially annoying when I change employers and I can't take these items with me to a new employer because they were never open sourced.

This repository seeks to be a kickstarter for me on how to properly create these documents by creating a simple repository that contains these documents so I can just crib them from my open source work.

Documents
---------

* `CONTRIBUTING.md` - This is largely based off the [`CONTRIBUTING.md` from Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). It encourages sensible naming of short lived branches and describes squashing commits so each pull request is a single commit.
